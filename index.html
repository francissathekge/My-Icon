                <br>
                <p>Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla. <br> <br>Elon Musk displayed an early talent in computers and video games and at the age of 12 created a video game code that earned him fame, as well as a fortune. He acquired a Canadian passport to avoid supporting apartheid in Africa at the time and also due to greater economic opportunities in the United States. <br> <br> Musk’s early interests in philosophy, science fiction, and fantasy novels are reflected in his idealism and concern with human progress—and in his business career. He works in fields he has identified as crucial to humanity's future, notably the transition to renewable energy sources, space exploration, and the Internet. Musk has defied critics, disrupted industries, and made the most money anyone ever has from PayPal, Tesla Motors, SolarCity, and SpaceX—game-changers all, despite the inevitable missteps. </p>

                    <h2>Tesla</h2>
                    <p>Tesla is perhaps Musk’s most well known business. Though no longer the company head, now CEO, Musk has had enormous say in how the company is run since 2008. The car company manufactures electric vehicles on a large scaling, earning him praise in an era where the world needs to cut down on emissions</p>

                    <h2>SpaceX</h2>
                    <p>Founded by Musk in 2002, SpaceX is an aerospace manufacturer. With NASA taking a backseat in space exploration since the 1980s, SpaceX and its competitors hope to be the companies that can take humanity further into the stars. For Musk, his aim is to make it commercially viable for humans to explore space and colonise the planet Mars.</p>

                    <h2>Neuralink</h2>
                    <p>Musk co-founded the neurological research company in 2016. Its aim is to treat serious brain disease, as well as attempt to link artificial intelligence with the human mind. Clinical trials are expected to begin soon. He has promised that the technology “will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs”.</p>

                    <h2>The Boring Company</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2016, the company is for Musk’s infrastructure planning. In the past, he has discussed his plans for a ‘Hyperloop’ transport system, basically underground tunnels for cars. The plans have been criticised for being more expensive and less practical compared public transportation methods, such as trains.</p>
